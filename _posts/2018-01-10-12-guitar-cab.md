It's difficult to find a guitar cab at your taste in term of design... At the end it's just a big cube! So I decided to build my own.

Also, when you start looking at 12 inches cab, you realized it's a lot more expensive than just the speaker.

I bought a 12" Celestion Vintage 30 from my local music shop, and found online (on this site: https://nextgenguitars.ca/)
- corners
- handle
- grill cloth
- jack plate
- jack socket
- rubber feet (mainly from this site:&nbsp;https://nextgenguitars.ca/)
- crimp terminals


I had wood from a previous (cat) project, so I decided to re-use it too.

Also I had some 2"x2" that helped me assembling the cab.

We can't see on the pictures but I also made a 12 inches hole in another plank of wood for the front side.
Then, some colored taint (find the one you like in your usual store).

Close the back and put the accessories.

Tadaaaa! A 12" guitar cab with a Celestion Vintage 30 for half of the price!
